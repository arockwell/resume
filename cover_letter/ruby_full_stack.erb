Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the role of <%= @position %> at <%= @company %>. My name is Alex Rockwell, and I bring a strong track record of developing scalable backend solutions, implementing site reliability engineering, developing front-end software, and leading technology teams. I'd like to tell you a little bit about some of the projects Iâ€™ve done that I think would make me an excellent fit for <%= @company %>.

Firstly, my work has always emphasized scalability. For example, at Doximity, I led the development of an ad event tracking pipeline that processed more than 250,000 ad events daily in real-time using Kafka and Ruby on Rails. Similarly, at Bleacher Report, I was responsible for designing a push notification service that scaled from 100,000 to 10 million users, sending over a billion notifications in the process.

In addition to building software, I have experience implementing site reliability engineering. I've used tools like Grafana, SumoLogic, and Datadog across various roles at Doximity, TeamSnap, 17Hats, and Quri. My work involved monitoring site performance, identifying bottlenecks, and implementing optimizations to reduce downtime and improve user experience.

I've also worked on a number of front-end projects. At Doximity, I worked on closed captioning for video calls in Javascript and Vue.js. At Quri, I helped revamped our internal tools creating NerveCenter, which employees used to manage the operations of the business in Coffeescript, React, and Redux.

In terms of leadership, my skills extend beyond code. I've presented at industry conferences, led cross-functional projects, and mentored engineers. Over the course of three years as tech lead at Doximity, I helped three other engineers level up to Senior Software Engineer, and become tech leads themselves. I also helped onboard four other engineers.
