Hi, 

I am a software engineer with experience in system administration, database design, data analysis, application development, and web design.

I have a wide variety of skills and enjoy using them on new and challenging projects. Here is a sample of the projects I have worked on in the past year:

 * Semantic web crawler to extract the organization hierarchy of UF from http://vivo.ufl.edu and draw the resulting graph (http://github.com/arockwell/vivo_org_chart)
 * Automated server installation and configuration with Ruby Chef
 * Data analysis script to find inconsistencies and clean up problems with data for http://vivo.ufl.edu (http://github.com/arockwell/vivo_analytics)
 * Several website scraping utilities (e.g., http://github.com/arockwell/vivo_webapi)
 * Parser written using Treetop for the RIS format (used for storing bibliographic references): http://github.com/arockwell/ris_parser
 * Simple Ruby on Rails app to store SPARQL queries that can be later run against any of our test or production environments (https://github.com/arockwell/vivo_report_saver)
 * Program to generate my resume in text and pdf format (http://github.com/arockwell/resume)

Almost all of my code written in the past year is available on GitHub. I work primarily in Ruby, but I enjoy programming in Javascript, Bash, Python, and Java. Additionally, I have experience as a system administrator on a wide variety of servers and platforms: Linux, MySQL, DB2, Apache, Tomcat, and JBoss.

Samples of my writing can be found on Stackoverflow and my blog:
 * Basic Metaprogramming with Ruby and Rake: http://alexrockwell.org/basic-metaprogramming-with-ruby-and-rake
 * Using Redis to Control Recurring Sets of Tasks: http://alexrockwell.org/using-redis-to-control-a-recurring-task-queue
 * What are the benefits of Mercurial or git over svn for branching and merging: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518779/what-are-the-benefits-of-mercurial-or-git-over-svn-for-branching-merging/2518930#2518930

Thanks for reading,
