Hi, I am a software engineer with experience in system administration, database design, data analysis, application development, and web design.

I have a wide variety of skills and enjoy using them on new and challenging projects. Here is a sample of the projects I have worked on in the past year:

* Automating server installation and configuration with Ruby Chef
* Semantic web crawler to extract the organization hierarchy of UF from http://vivo.ufl.edu and draw the resulting graph (http://github.com/arockwell/vivo_org_chart)
* Several data analysis and manipulation script to find inconsistencies and clean up problems with data for http://vivo.ufl.edu
* Several website scraping utilities (e.g., http://github.com/arockwell/vivo_webapi)
* Parser written using Treetop for the RIS format (used for storing bibliographic references): http://github.com/arockwell/ris_parser
* Simple RoR app to store SPARQL queries to run against any of our test and production environments (https://github.com/arockwell/vivo_report_saver)

Almost all of my code written in the past year is available on GitHub. I work primarily in Ruby, but I enjoy programming in Javascript, Bash, Python, and Java. Additionally, I have experience as a system administrator on a wide variety of servers and platforms: Linux, MySQL, DB2, Apache, Tomcat, and JBoss.

If you are interested in seeing some of my writing take a look at my blog (http://alexrockwell.org) or my Stack Overflow profile (http://stackoverflow.com/users/65225/alex-rockwell). My most popular article is about my experience with working with Redis: http://alexrockwell.org/using-redis-to-control-a-recurring-task-queue.

Thanks for reading,

Alex Rockwell
